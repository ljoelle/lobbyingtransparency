        <h2>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h2>
        <ul>
  <li>Lobbying is a legitimate activity and an important part of the democratic process</li>
  <li>There is a significant public interest in ensuring the transparency and integrity of lobbying, as well as diversity of participation and contribution to public decision-making</li>
  <li>Any regulatory measures to secure these ends shall be proportionate, fit for purpose and not impede on the individual rights of assembly, free speech and petition of government.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Guiding Notes</h3>
            <div>
                <p>These Lobbying Standards start off with recognising that a democratic society is based on a <strong>pluralism of interests</strong>. All members of society are constantly “lobbying” for what they want: citizens communicate with administrative bodies; organise in associations and political parties; choose representatives in parliament; take to the street for manifestations; or hold referenda.</p>

<p>In real life, however, not all members of society have the same capacity to make themselves heard and to participate. Some stakeholders have more money to put into lobbying activities; others have privileged access to decision makers. In other words: equal interests compete with <strong>unequal means</strong> for the attention of public officials.</p>

<p>Thus, it is the not the aim of lobbying regulations to simply burden a small segment of society, in particular lobbyists, with administrative obligations. Nor is it the aim to impede political rights of citizens. Quite the opposite, the better the lobbying regulation, the more “lobbyists” a society has, ideally all citizens with <strong>equal opportunities</strong>.</p>

<p>As of May 2015, at least <strong>20 countries</strong> worldwide have a specific lobbying regulation in place at the national level (depending on where one sets the threshold for counting a regulation): Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Peru, Poland, Slovenia, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States. Even though lobbying regulations are found mostly in industrialised regions, they are a matter of any country: lobbying scandals all around the world including in developing countries are testimony to this need for regulation.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A number of publications in the last years are prove of the growing interest in lobbying regulation, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>OECD “Lobbyists, Government and Public Trust”, Volume 1 “Increasing Transparency through Legislation” (2009), Volume 2 “Promoting Integrity through Self-regulation” (2012), Volume 3 “Implementing the OECD Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” (2014).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Sunlight Foundation, International Lobbying Disclosure Guidelines, 2013.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Access Info Europe, Lobbying Transparency via Right to Information Laws, 2013.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Transparency International, Lobbying in Europe – Hidden Influence, Privileged Access, 2015.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>These Standards do not only address national legislators, but also <strong>international organisations</strong> as they define policies and legislation of nation states. However, some parts of these Standards will not be applicable to international organisations, as they do not have full legislative powers as nation states do (for further details see next chapter on “Regulatory Scope”).</p>

        <h2>REGULATORY SCOPE</h2>
        <p>The lobbying framework should clearly and unambiguously define what is lobbying and who is to be considered a lobbyist and lobbying target for the purposes of regulation.</p>

        <aside class="guiding-notes">
            <h3>Guiding Notes</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Defining lobbying and the lobbying target is the pivotal point of a regulation: without a definition, there are neither obligations nor rights for stakeholders. Experience with lobbying regulation shows that weak definitions are probably the main cause for loopholes. One word can decide, for example, whether in-house lobbyists are included or not, or whether a lobbyist can hide behind the activities of a non-profit organisation.</p>

<p>A clear definition is also necessary to avoid any inadvertent curtailment of democratic rights, something, to which the third guiding principle draws attention to. For example, defining the term “lobbyist” too broadly might – taken literally – include members of parliament (who constantly try to influence each others’ decision-making).</p>

<p>Thus, defining lobbying walks a rather thin line between embracing all lobbying activities in need of regulation, and safeguarding the democratic freedoms of ordinary citizens. In this context, the OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">1</a></sup> of 2010 call in Principle 4 for definitions to “be robust, comprehensive and sufficiently explicit to avoid misinterpretation and to prevent loopholes.”</p>
